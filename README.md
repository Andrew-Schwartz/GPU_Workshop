# GPU Workshop
### Run on April 19

A gpu programmming workshop for the Rutgers SPS.
The main notebook is [gpu_event.ipynb](https://github.com/Andrew-Schwartz/GPU_Workshop/blob/master/gpu_event.ipynb), which has empty code blocks throughout that you can complete to learn about GPU programming. 
There is also a secondary file, [gpu_event_solution.ipynb](https://github.com/Andrew-Schwartz/GPU_Workshop/blob/master/gpu_event_solution.ipynb), which has the code blocks completed to see the solution.

The [powerpoint](https://github.com/Andrew-Schwartz/GPU_Workshop/blob/master/GPU%20Event.pptx) has a couple of associated slides.
